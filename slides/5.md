# How to Learn TypeScript

- Start with just TypeScript, don’t focus on React immediately
- Build a simple application or tool
- Don’t convert a project as your first means of learning
- If you do decide to convert an app, convert from the top down, not the bottom up
- Categorize learning materials, and use them appropriately
  - Survey level:
    - [Understanding TypeScript’s type notation](https://2ality.com/2018/04/type-notation-typescript.html)
    - [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
  - Reference level:
    - [React TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/)
    - [TypeScript Handbook | Utility Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html)
  - Deep dive:
    - [Programming TypeScript ](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/)
- Start with a simple tsconfig file, I like the one [Next.js provides](https://gist.github.com/brookslybrand/618f9690e1a1a5853231f9fd416306e1#file-nextjs-based-tsconfig-json) as well as a [modified version of Remix’s](https://gist.github.com/brookslybrand/618f9690e1a1a5853231f9fd416306e1#file-remix-based-tsconfig-json)
- My only strong opinion is to set `noImplicitAny` to true
- It’s okay to not understand everything in a config file when you’re starting out. From what I can tell, most people just muck around with their tsconfig until they get something they like. As you get better you’ll form stronger opinions—something you don’t need when you’re getting started.
- Try to avoid using the `any` type when you’re first learning. Some types will be difficult to think about, but that’s part of the learning process! If something is really complicated, try writing it in a different way.
