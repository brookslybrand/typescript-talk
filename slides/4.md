# But what about React/frontend?

There is a myth that TypeScript is good for node/backend code, or maybe even libraries, but difficult and slow when it comes to frontend code/React

I disagree

1. TypeScript + React has improved significant
2. The majority of popular libraries are written in TS or are typed via [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
3. If anything, TS is more valuable when it comes to React components and hooks
