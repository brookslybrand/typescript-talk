# But what about React/frontend?

There is a myth that TypeScript is good for node/backend code and libraries, but difficult and slows down frontend/React development

**I disagree**

- TypeScript + React has improved significant
- The majority of popular libraries are written in TS or are typed via [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
- If anything, TS is more valuable when it comes to React components and hooks
