# Why I use TypeScript

## The good

- Helps avoid bugs via a shorter and more explicit feedback loop
- TypeScript makes it easier to communicate to both the computer and other programmers: https://twitter.com/LWJShow/status/1428077699625472004
- TypeScript saves you time

## The tradeoff(s)

- There is an upfront cost
  - IMO: 1 month of actively using it before becoming proficient (enough)
  - It took me just under a year from [start](https://twitter.com/BrooksLybrand/status/1196909418052501507) to [finish](https://twitter.com/BrooksLybrand/status/1313961433848336384)
- It can _feel_ like it's slowing you down
  - Often the speed and efficiency comes with time saved for your coworkers and future self
